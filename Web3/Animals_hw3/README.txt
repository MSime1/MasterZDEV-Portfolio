Build an ERC1155 contract that includes both fungible and non-fungible elements, create images and metadata on IPFS, perform the appropriate functionality tests locally, deploy it on a testnet (of your choice), verify it, and display it on a marketplace (such as OpenSea or another).



Contract deployed anche can be see on Opensea testnet.
